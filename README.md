Advent of Code 2022

## Log

### Day 1

First day is usually easy and intented for setting up stuff. I used Belen's [aoc-2021](https://github.com/belen-albeza/aoc-2021) as a template for the project. I'm a bit *rusty* in Rust and no expert, so I just made a simple solution to get the stars in. When I get more experience maybe I'll find a better way for doing this.

### Day 2

Second day I started with a quick and dirty solution without any kind of Rust idiom. In the afternoon I had some free time that I used to clean the solution a bit and I used the `match` expressions quite extensively.
